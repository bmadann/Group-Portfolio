            <h2>Benefits of CSS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Separation of Content and Design:</strong> CSS allows for the separation of the content of HTML from the design and formatting. This makes it easier to maintain and update.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Consistent Look and Feel:</strong> CSS ensures that the look and feel of a website is consistent across different pages and platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced File Size:</strong> By using CSS, the HTML document can be less cluttered and the overall file size can be reduced, improving load times.</li>
